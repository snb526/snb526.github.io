									<section>
									<p>
									
									<li><b>A</b></li>
							<b>AL DENTE</b>
							Generally used in terms of pasta and rice cooking, but technically includes vegetables and beans too. Al dente is translated as ‘to the tooth’ meaning something cooked but left with a bite of firmness.
</br>
							<b>AU GRATIN </b>
							Sprinkled with breadcrumbs and cheese, or both, and browned.The phrase ‘au gratin’ literally means “by grating” in French, or “with a crust”.
							</br>
							<b>AU JUS</b>
							With its own juices from cooking, often refers to steak or other meat.
</br>
							<b>AU SEC</b>
							Description of a liquid which has been reduced until it’s almost nearly dry, a process often used in sauce making.</br></br>
							
							
							
									<li><b>B</b></li>
							<b>BARDING</b>
							To cover a meat with a layer of fat before cooking, it maintains the moisture of the meat while it cooks to avoid overcooking.
</br>
							<b>BASTE</b>
							To pour melted fat or the juices of the liquid over meat or other food while cooking to keep it moist.
</br>
							<b>BLANCH</b>
							A quick method of cooking food, usually green vegetables, whereby the item is basically scalded in boiling hot water for a short period of time and then refreshed in ice cold water. This ensures that the veggie retains its bright green colour and a good firm texture.
</br>
							<b>BROIL</b>
							Normally a term used in the States, broil is what we know as grilling. Basically, you preheat the hot rod or grill at the top of your oven until it gets exceptionally hot. Place the food on an oven tray under the preheated grill until it browns and has some incredible flavour.
</br>
							<b>BRAISE</b>
							Braising is an old French method of cooking meat. It uses a combination of dry and moist heat, dry being when the meat is seared at a high heat and moist when it’s gently cooked in a liquid. This cooking method is ideal with sinewy, tougher cuts of meat.
</br>

							The process of soaking meat in a brine, or heavily salted water, before cooking.

</br>
